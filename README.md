# jinder-Flask

A one-month Capstone Project with end-to-end software development life cycle. Jinder is a SpringBoot app that also employs Machine Learning via Text Processing conducted in a Flask server. The SpringBoot app calls Flask REST API to get the ML results and display them on Thymeleaf. Jobs and other data are stored in MySQL database.

The Flask server contains a few functions mapped to the different features employed in our application. Libraries used for Text Processin are NLTK and SciKit-Learn. The server is aslo able to read data from MySQL with imported libraries and Pandas is used to manipulate the data to be sent to the SpringBoot app. MatPlotLib is used to display graphs and BeautifulSoup is used for the web scrapping.
